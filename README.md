# Weather App By Nikolaj Nowicki

## Short Summary

This is a weather application made by me for my first solo JavaScript project in school. It was my first time dabbling with API's and it was a lot of fun to get everything to work.

The app takes your browsers geolocation to show you the weather near you, and there is also and option to search for any city's current weather in the world.

You can try out the app here: https://medieinstitutet.github.io/fed22d-js-grundkurs-2-weather-app-nikolajnowicki/
